# hello-world
Trying out a repository
My name is Roberto, but I prefer Bert. 22 year old (he/him). ih sih gageas
I started learning coding basics in Codecademy, and have decided to venture into GitHub to see how I can take what I've learned into another coding-related format. I probably won't have anything special in my GitHub account. If I ever reach the point where I do learn enough about coding/GitHub, then I will gladly add my own projects.
Otherwise, I can be found online at the handle intrpidbhaviors (except Tumblr, at intrepidbehaviors).
